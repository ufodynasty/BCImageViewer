   long. A 13-bit codeword is found exactly once in the table, at an
   index equal to its codeword: for instance the codeword
   1110110010101 is at index 7573, where you will see 0x551d. If a
   codeword is b bits long, it appears 2**(13-b) times, at all the
   locations whose indexes start with the codeword. For instance the
   codeword 000 appears 1024 times at the locations whose indexes
   start with 000 in binary, namely 0 through 1023, where you will see
   0x23.

   The information about each codeword is packed into 16 bits. The top
   8 bits represent the difference between samples that is encoded.
   (It's most intuitive to think of as signed, though an unsigned
   interpretation would be equivalent.) The next 4 bits count how many
   sample differences have that value. The final, lowest 4 bits are
   the length of the codeword in bits. Every codeword is at least 3
   bits long.

   This table is pretty long, but it replaces over 100 lines of
   hard-to-audit if statements and bitwise arithmetic in a previous
   version.
